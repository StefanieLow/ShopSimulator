# ShopSimulator

This program demonstrates basic business management concepts by having the user run a shop. In the game, the user will be tasked with making as much profit as possible from opening a shop within a ten-day period. The player will:
- buy items 
- invest in shop upgrades
- determine a sale price for the item
- check sales during the day. 
They can decide to give increase or decrease the sale price if they believe it will be beneficial. At the end, they can use their profit to buy more slots for items or to replenish current stock. 

The score is the profit after the 10 day period is over. To increase difficulty, the simulator will take place during different seasons (ie: more profit could be made right before Christmas than in a given week in April) depending on the chosen difficulty level.The flow of customers will also change depending on the season, as well as how well different items sell.
